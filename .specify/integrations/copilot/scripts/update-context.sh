# This is the copilot-specific implementation that produces the GitHub
# Copilot instructions file. The shared dispatcher reads
# .specify/integration.json and calls this script.
#
# NOTE: This script is not yet active. It will be activated in Stage 7
# when the shared update-agent-context.sh replaces its case statement
# with integration.json-based dispatch. The shared script must also be
# refactored to support SPECKIT_SOURCE_ONLY (guard the main logic)
# before sourcing will work.
#
# Until then, this delegates to the shared script as a subprocess.
